# LendingClub-Loan-Data-Project
A final project for my "Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis" class at New College of Florida during my sophomore year on LendingClub loans. Please look at the .pdf file for the complete project, visualizations, etc. To see the code, look at the .rmd file. I also included the powerpoint used for the presentation at the end of class.
